<b>About ChromaCalendar</b>:
There are approximately 3 million color-blind people in the United States. Color blind people are usually misrepresented in the society, avoiding activities such as interest groups, politics, and even reaching out to their community. We created Chroma Calendar with one vision: to increase the accessibility of progressive technology for those who cannot use digital calendars to its full extent.

Color vision deficiency is the inability to distinguish certain shades of color. The term "color blindness" is also used to describe this visual condition, but very few people are completely color blind. Most people with color vision deficiency can see colors, but they have difficulty differentiating between particular shades of reds and greens (most common) or blues and yellows (less common). People who are totally color blind, a condition called achromatopsia, can only see things as black and white or in shades of gray. 

<b>Our Mission:</b> The mission of Chroma Calendar is to provide the perfect amount of structure, balance, and assistance to those affected by colorblindness.

<b>Our Hope:</b> Thorough our calendar, we hope to make living with colorblindness more simple and organized. Our simple, elegant design keeps day-to-day life easy and fast.
